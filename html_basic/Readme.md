HTML Basics Project
📘 Overview
This is my HTML Basics Project, where I'm learning the core building blocks of web development. The goal is to understand how HTML works and how to use it to create structured, well-written web pages.

🎯 What I’ve Learned
By completing this project, I’m now able to:

✅ Explain what HTML is and how it works.

✅ Understand what a markup language is and how it helps browsers render content.

✅ Use HTML tags and attributes correctly to structure content.

✅ Write valid, semantic HTML to create web pages from scratch.

🛠️ What I Can Do Now
With the skills I’ve gained, I can:

📝 Build basic web pages like personal bios, lists, and simple documents.

🔍 Read and write clean HTML code with confidence.

🚀 Start learning CSS and JavaScript to take my web development skills further.

📁 How I Got Started
I created a new project folder and added HTML files.

I practiced writing markup by creating real pages and viewing them in my browser.

I focused on using proper tags, indentation, and semantics for clean code.

💡 What’s Next
Now that I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, I’m planning to:

Learn CSS to style my pages and make them visually appealing.

Start exploring JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic content.
